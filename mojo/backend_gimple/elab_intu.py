# In-TU generic instantiation — materialize an IMPORTED generic as a real
# definition in THIS translation unit, instead of an `extern` declaration
# beside a separately-compiled CAS object.
#
# WHY this exists, and what it is not.
#
# The `.o` route (`elaborate.Elaborator` -> `monomorphize.instantiate` ->
# `cas.get_or_build`) hands the caller a set of `extern` declarations whose
# parameter types are the ELABORATOR's erased view (`elaborate._mojo_type`), a
# stateless reduction with no access to this compile's `struct_field_types`.
# The object it links was compiled by a real host codegen pass that inferred
# the TRUE parameter types. For most generics the two views agree and the route
# works. For the `std/iter` iterator family they provably cannot: every one of
# `_Empty`, `_Once`, `_PeekableIterator`, `_MapIterator`, `_ZipIterator`,
# `_ChainedIterator` and `_Enumerate` overloads `__iter__` on `var self` AND on
# `ref self`, both overloads erase to `(Struct *)`, so
# `_register_generic_struct` sees two object symbols
# (`_Empty_1_T_3_Int___iter___0120be` and `_0120be_2`) and no way to know which
# one a call site means — it registers NEITHER and declines the struct. The
# same wall stops `FormatStruct`'s two `fields`. The information is gone in one
# direction: the erasure that makes two overloads look identical is the same
# erasure that destroys the function `overload_suffix_for` is computed from.
#
# Splicing the monomorphized SOURCE into this TU's own statement list sidesteps
# the whole problem: this codegen then names its own methods with real
# inference, and the call sites reach them through `_struct_method_csym` and
# `func_return_types` exactly as they do for a locally-written struct. The
# already-landed struct-protocol branches (`emit_calls._lower_call`'s
# `next(<struct>)`, `emit_loops._gen_for_struct_iter`'s `for x in <struct>`)
# then take over unchanged.
#
# WHY it is a PRE-PASS whose output goes into `gen_module`'s own `stmts`.
#
# Struct registration (`all_struct_defs` and every pass derived from it),
# `func_return_types`, and the struct-typedef emission each read the statement
# list once, early. A demand-driven hook at the call site would arrive long
# after those passes ran, so the materialized struct would have a name and no
# layout. Hence: find the call sites in the AST — no lowering is needed, because
# a type argument is either written in brackets or is a literal whose Mojo type
# is exact — monomorphize to source, PARSE, and append, before the first
# struct-registration loop. The call site in `module_gen.py` names the exact
# position and what it must stay after.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT.
#
# It lowers nothing and changes no call-site dispatch: it produces statements,
# and every pass downstream is unchanged. It REFUSES rather than guesses — a
# type argument it cannot prove concrete, a template it cannot find, a bind
# that leaves a parameter unbound, and a malformed annotation all mean "no
# in-TU instantiation", and the `.o` route then runs exactly as it did before
# in-TU existed. That rule is the whole point: the reverted first attempt
# (2026-10-02) narrowed the FEATURE to dodge `error: conflicting types for
# '<name>'`, which turns a wrong artifact into a smaller wrong artifact instead
# of into a refusal.
