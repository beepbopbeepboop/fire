## BUG: `ARM64Codegen.__init__()` does not accept `dylib_syms` — every formal build fails

**Status:** FIXED (reported 2026-09-25, `test_x86_64_examples.py` back to 43/43
within the minute; the arm64 side now takes the same `dylib_syms` keyword the
x86-64 side does). Kept for the record. **Affects:** every `./fire.py build
--formal` (arm64 is the default backend), which died before emitting a byte.
**Found:** 2026-09-25, from `test_x86_64_examples.py`, whose arm64 reference leg
went from 43/43 to 0/43 with:

```
TypeError: ARM64Codegen.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'dylib_syms'
```

**Not mine to fix** — the in-flight dylib-linking change in `formal/build.py`
introduces it. I have completed the x86-64 half of the same interface
(`X86_64Codegen.__init__(test_input, extern_style, dylib_syms)`, mangling the
callee to the linked dylib's exported spelling), so only the arm64 side is
outstanding.

### The mismatch

`formal/build.py:540-551`

```python
def _make_codegen(arch: str, fmt: str, test_input: int, dylib_syms: dict = None):
    if arch == "arm64":
        return ARM64Codegen(test_input=test_input, dylib_syms=dylib_syms)
```

`formal/arm64_codegen.py:374`

```python
def __init__(self, test_input: int = 10):
```

### Fix

Either accept and store the map in `ARM64Codegen.__init__` (and use it at the
call site the way `formal/x86_64_codegen.py:_emit_call` does), or drop the
keyword at `formal/build.py:551` until the arm64 side is ready. The first is
what keeps `--backend=arm64` and `--backend=x86_64` on one interface.

### Why it is worth catching with a test rather than by eye

`_make_codegen` is shared by both backends now, so a keyword added for one of
them breaks the other at *runtime*, and only on the branch that takes it —
nothing at import time, and a build-only check that never reaches the
constructor's mismatch would still be green. `test_x86_64_examples.py` catches
it because it builds the same example through BOTH backends.
