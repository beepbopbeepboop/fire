"""Build formal-backend executables and RUN them, checking the answers.

test_formal.py only ever typechecks the generated proof; it never executes the
binary, which is why an entire class of Mach-O emission bugs could sit there
green: images dyld refused to load (SIGKILL at exec), an LC_CODE_SIGNATURE that
landed on the first instructions, a GOT slot nothing ever bound so the call stub
branched through zero. Every one of those produced a *correct proof* about code
that could not run.

This suite executes instead. Each case names the exit status (and stdout) the
program must produce, so "it linked" and "it computed the right answer" are
separate assertions. Grounded in what clang/ld emits: a working image and a
broken one differ in load-command details, and this is the test that notices.
