"""Module-global state: build the image, RUN it, and check the answer.

`test_formal_run.py` covers expressions; this covers state that lives in the
module rather than in a frame, and it exists because of a specific way that goes
wrong. Before module-global storage existed, `GlobalStmt` was a no-op in both
backends, so

    G = 5
    def bump():
        global G
        G = G + 1

compiled, linked, and PRINTED 5 — the write landed in a dead register and the
read was folded to the module's constant. Nothing failed. The proof obligations
were discharged; the binary was wrong. So every case here is executed, and the
number it produces is the assertion.

THREE ENGINES PER CASE. A module global is the one feature in this backend whose
correctness depends on a second module agreeing about where a slot lives — the
codegen computes an address, the linker maps a segment, and nothing in between
checks them. That is exactly the class of defect where one architecture can be
right and the other wrong with both green elsewhere, and it was not
hypothetical: an x86-64 image whose `__DATA` was addressed RIP-relative ran
correctly under lldb and died of SIGSEGV standalone, because the loader slides
the image and `GLOBALS_VM` is a fixed address.

So each case runs the same source three ways and requires all three to agree:

  * `fire.py run` — the Mojo interpreter, which is the reference SEMANTICS. It
    shares no code with the formal backend below the parser, so agreement is
    evidence rather than a tautology.
  * the arm64 image, natively.
  * the x86-64 image, under Rosetta.

Requiring the backends to agree with each other is not redundant with the
interpreter comparison: the interpreter has no `__DATA`, no slot index and no
image, so a whole class of bug (address arithmetic, segment placement, lazy
initialization ordering) is invisible to it and can only be caught by two
independent codegens landing on the same number.
