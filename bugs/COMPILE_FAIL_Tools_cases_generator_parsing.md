# COMPILE_FAIL: Tools/cases_generator/parsing.py

Source file: `/Users/mrs/net/Python-3.14.6/Tools/cases_generator/parsing.py`

(Found via full Python-3.14.6 source tree scan, not the earlier 100-file Lib/ sample.)

## Status (updated 2026-08-06)

Re-ran; current error is entirely in a transitively-imported sibling,
not this file's own code:

```
/Users/mrs/net/Python-3.14.6/Tools/cases_generator/cwriter.py:20:1: error: non-trivial conversion in 'integer_cst'
/Users/mrs/net/Python-3.14.6/Tools/cases_generator/cwriter.py:20:1: error: type mismatch in binary expression
```

Same root cause as `bugs/COMPILE_FAIL_Tools_cases_generator_cwriter.md`
(comprehension-assigned struct field defaulting to `int` — see
`bugs/hard/CODEGEN_unannotated_init_param_field_type_defaults_int64.md`).
Nothing specific to `parsing.py` itself was found. Not fixed here.

```
