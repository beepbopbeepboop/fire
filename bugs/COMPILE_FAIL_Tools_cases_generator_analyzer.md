# COMPILE_FAIL: Tools/cases_generator/analyzer.py

Source file: `/Users/mrs/net/Python-3.14.6/Tools/cases_generator/analyzer.py`

(Found via full Python-3.14.6 source tree scan, not the earlier 100-file Lib/ sample.)

## Status (2026-08-07)

Re-ran after this session's `_compr_range_loop` fix (see `bugs/
COMPILE_FAIL_Tools_cases_generator_cwriter.md` for the fix itself) — the
2026-08-06 error below is GONE, but this file (via the same
transitively-imported `cwriter.py`) now hits a different, deeper,
unfixed bug in that same sibling file: `cwriter.py:35:3: internal
compiler error: in build2, at tree.cc:5204`. Still failing overall; see
`cwriter.py`'s own doc for the full remaining-issue breakdown (a real
GCC ICE plus the still-excluded task #143 field-typing gap). Not
independently investigated further here.

## Status (updated 2026-08-06, historical)

Re-ran; current error is entirely in a transitively-imported sibling,
not this file's own code:

```
/Users/mrs/net/Python-3.14.6/Tools/cases_generator/cwriter.py:20:1: error: non-trivial conversion in 'integer_cst'
/Users/mrs/net/Python-3.14.6/Tools/cases_generator/cwriter.py:20:1: error: type mismatch in binary expression
```

Root-caused in `bugs/COMPILE_FAIL_Tools_cases_generator_cwriter.md` (a
comprehension-assigned struct field defaulting to `int` instead of
`MojoList *` — new sibling gap added to
`bugs/hard/CODEGEN_unannotated_init_param_field_type_defaults_int64.md`).
`analyzer.py` imports `lexer`/`cwriter` transitively; nothing specific
to `analyzer.py` itself was found. Not fixed here — see that doc.
